## Opening the project in Godot

To get started simply open this folder's project.godot in Godot 4.4, the addons are already included in the project

## Development Notes

- Place exported GLB files in `models/` (see [Modelling assets/_GLBs_go_in_godot_project_models_folder.txt](../Modelling%20assets/_GLBs_go_in_godot_project_models_folder.txt)).
- UI elements for floor selection are in `scenes/main.tscn`.

## Dependencies

### Workflow

1. Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2. Create a feature branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes, following the development guidelines below.
4. Run tests and verify that the main scene (`scenes/main.tscn`) runs without errors.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of what youâ€™ve added or changed.

### Development Guidelines

- Use clean scene hierarchies, clear node names, and modular, readable GDScript.
- Place new files in their appropriate directories (`scenes/`, `scripts/`, `models/`, etc.).
- Use inline comments for scripts and update relevant README sections as needed.
- Ensure the main scene continues to function after your changes.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages for easier review.
